06/2021: I'm interning at Google Brain Montr√©al for the summer, hosted by [Fabian Pedregosa](http://fa.bianp.net/pages/about.html)! I'll be working on optimization methods tied to program synthesis. Keep posted!

10/2020: We've open sourced [CHOP](https://github.com/openopt/chop), our optimization library built on Pytorch. CHOP contains methods for constrained and composite optimization, with a focus on 1) generating adversarial examples, 2) training sparse and structured neural networks. 

06/2020: Our paper [Stochastic Frank-Wolfe for Constrained Finite-Sum Optimization](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v119/negiar20a.html) (**G. Negiar**, G. Dresdner, A. Y. Tsai, L. El Ghaoui, F. Locatello, R. Freund, F. Pedregosa) was accepted to the [ICML 2020](https://icml.cc) main conference!

03/2020: I'm a finalist for the [Two Sigma](https://twosigma.com) PhD Fellowship!

01/2020: Our paper [Linearly Convergent Frank-Wolfe with Backtracking Line-Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.05123) (F. Pedregosa, **G. Negiar**, A. Askari and M. Jaggi) was accepted to [AISTATS 2020](https://www.aistats.org/accepted.html)!
