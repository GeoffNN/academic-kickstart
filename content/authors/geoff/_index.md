I'm a 5th-year PhD student in UC Berkeley’s [BAIR](https://bair.berkeley.edu/), co-advised by [Prof. Michael Mahoney](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~mmahoney/) and [Prof. El Ghaoui](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~elghaoui/). My research focuses on leveraging mathematical optimization to incorporate and analyze structure in learning systems.

I'm currently a Student Researcher at Google Research, hosted by [Fabian Predregosa](http://fa.bianp.net/pages/about.html), remotely in Montréal. I'm a member of the [French Armament Corps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corps_de_l%27armement) (DGA, i.e. French DARPA Fellowship). I enjoy applying my research to industry problems: I've interned at [Bloomberg LP](https://www.bloomberg.com/company/), [Shift Technology](https://www.shift-technology.com/), and was a part time researcher at [SumUp Analytics](http://www.sumup.ai/).
